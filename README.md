# Even-or-odd-calculator
After seeing someone make an even or odd calculator from a leetcode problem, I tried to make it as efficient and as little code as possible.

There are no instructions as it returns the proper solution non inputted, as intended.  The purpose of this is to show how to tell the computer what is even and what is odd, with as little code as possible.
